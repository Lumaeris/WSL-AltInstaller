## v0.0.1-alpha - 2023-04-29

Initial release.

### Known issues
- aria2 downloads with a maximum of 5 threads, even if I set it to 16.
- "The service has not been started" appeared during testing for no reason. I was installing WSL and Ubuntu in about the same way the script does. I need to perform some testing...
- **Very** limited functionality.
